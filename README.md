I am an IT student completing my Final semester of Bachelor's degree. I love developing websites and solving tricky problems. I have previously done internships and have gained a good exposure as a developer and a software engineer.
- Currently I am working as a Software engineer Intern.

#### My Interests Include:
- Coding and solving DSA problems (C++).
- Developing websites.
- Working on projects that are unique and different.

##### I am open to:
- Learning new tech stacks.
- Collaborating and working on different projects.
- Internships that force me to think out of the box.
